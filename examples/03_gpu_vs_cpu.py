Example 3 — GPU vs CPU Benchmark
=================================

Runs the same VQE calculation on both GPU and CPU backends and compares
wall-clock performance.

Why GPU matters for VQE
-----------------------
A single VQE iteration requires evaluating ⟨ψ(θ)|H|ψ(θ)⟩, which involves:

  1. Preparing |ψ(θ)⟩ — applying the parameterised circuit
  2. Computing expectation values for each Pauli term in the Hamiltonian

For a molecule with N qubits, the statevector has 2^N amplitudes, and each
gate is a 2^N × 2^N matrix multiply (or sparse equivalent). On a GPU, these
are massively parallelised — thousands of amplitudes updated simultaneously.

A typical VQE runs 100–500 iterations, each with dozens of Pauli evaluations.
The GPU speedup compounds across all of these.

What Maestro offers
-------------------
- **CPU by default** — works out of the box, no license needed
- **GPU upgrade** — switch to GPU for dramatic speedups on larger systems
- **Same API** — switching from CPU to GPU is a single argument change
- **No code changes** — your circuit, ansatz, and optimiser are identical

What this example shows
-----------------------
- Identical VQE on H₂ with both CPU and GPU backends
- Side-by-side timing comparison
- Both yield the same energy (within optimiser tolerance)
