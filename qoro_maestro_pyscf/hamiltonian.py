Hamiltonian construction: PySCF integrals → OpenFermion QubitOperator.

Converts one- and two-electron integrals (as delivered by PySCF's CASCI/CASSCF
``kernel`` call) into a qubit Hamiltonian via the Jordan-Wigner transformation.
The resulting Pauli terms are formatted for Maestro's ``estimate()`` API.

    Convert PySCF one- and two-electron integrals to a qubit Hamiltonian.

    Supports both RHF (single arrays) and UHF (tuple of spin-resolved arrays)

        Two-electron integrals in chemist's notation. Single array for RHF;
