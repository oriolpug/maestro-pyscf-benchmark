Hamiltonian construction: PySCF integrals → OpenFermion QubitOperator.

Converts one- and two-electron integrals (as delivered by PySCF's CASCI/CASSCF
``kernel`` call) into a qubit Hamiltonian via the Jordan-Wigner transformation.
The resulting Pauli terms are formatted for Maestro's ``estimate()`` API.
